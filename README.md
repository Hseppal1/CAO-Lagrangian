# CAO-Lagrangian

This repository includes netcdf files of processed MODIS, Aqua and Terra, and ERA-5 data. The files can be easily opened using xarray. Each file represents a distinct cold air outbreak event, and lists cloud properties as a function of parcel age since cloud formation and path ID.
